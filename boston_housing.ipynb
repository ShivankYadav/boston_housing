    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

The lurning cureve of max_depth =10 looks a lot like that of an overfit model since training score is a constant 100%. By analysing the other learning curves I would select the curve with max_depth= 3 since it has better testing score than that of 6.\n",

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias. The model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data which is shown by low magnititude of both validation and training score.\n",
    "2. When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10, does the model suffer from high variance. The model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well. The Training score is very high suggesting that the model has memorised the training data and is not general enough resulting in a comparetively low validation score. \n"

    "\n",

    "Let us assume we have 100 rows in total. Out of these 100 rows, let us say 20 rows are taken out for final testing of the model and 80 rows are kept for training. Now these 80 rows are divided into k-folds. If we assume k to be 10, then each fold consists of 8 rows. Now out of these folds, one fold having 8 rows is kept as validation and rest 72 rows are used as training. This process is repeated with each fold being one validation set.\n",

The data set in the fixed train-test method may result in optimum hyper-parameter combination which is good for only that particularly arranged training dataset.

    "We take one hyperparameter combination from the grid and keep it constant for one round of whole k-fold cross validation process: the whole splitting into kfolds, training and validating on one fold and so on. This helps us in getting an unbiased estimate of model evaluation metric which helps us decide in a more unbiased way, whether the given combination of hyperparameters is best for the particular data set or not.

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "- How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?\n",
    "- Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The model should not be used in the real- world setting because it has been trained on older irrelevant data.\n",
    "It's irrelevant since the target variable is the median of prices of homes,and due to inflation, the cost would have incresed all- over and the target prices would be higher in the present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the features describing the prices would still matter. The features are sufficient enought for the model(since, quality of appliances would generally be same in a high class neighbourhood, therefore would increse the prices all houses in the neighbourhood all together; square feet of plot area is similar to the number of rooms, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model can be improved with few more parameters ,if we are able to find some more. Other features like vicinity with hospital, supermarkets, and backyard pool,etc can be included to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, data collected in an urban city like Boston would not be applicable in a rural city.\n",
    "Yes, we can judge the price of individual home based on the locality because people tend to have similar house characterstics within the same neighbourhood, moreover, two features in the data are neighbourhood related only."
